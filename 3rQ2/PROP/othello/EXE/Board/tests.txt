This document contains a brief description of each test, as well as their inputs and outputs. The inputs are shown in the format of the personalized mode of the driver.

-- Test 1: Constructors and other lateral functions
This test can not be replicated in the personalized mode. It creates a default board, loads another board from a file and compares them. Then, it copies the loaded board and compares the original with the copy. Finally, a string is created from the copy using the function toString. Multiple messages are thrown during the test to identify which part it's being executed.
Thanks to this test we can ensure the correctness of the constructor functions, as well as the equals, toString and print  functions.

-- Test2: limits
This test perform some moves on the board, trying to reach the limits of it.
Through this test we can prove the preciseness of many functions as can_capture, capture, is_valid, set, pieces, available_positions and can_play

-- Test 4: errors
This test will execute some operations with invalid arguments.
Thanks to this test we can check how some functions react before invalid inputs.
This test can not be replicated through the personalized mode.
